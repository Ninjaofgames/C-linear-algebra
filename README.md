# C linear algebra library <br>
A linear algebra library written in C.

⚠️ **Work in Progress (WIP)**: <br>
Matrix operations are implemented ✅  
Vector operations are still under research 🚧

---

## Features
- Identity matrix & null matrix
- Random matrix (using Mersenne Twister or mt19937)
- Compare two matrixes
- Adding two matrixes
- Scalar multiplication
- Check triangular matrixes
- Transpose
- Trace
- Minor matrixes
- Determinant
- Multiplying two matrixes (knowed in Python as matmul())

## Planned:
- Vector operations
- Eigenvalues & decomposition
- Optimizations

---

# ⚠️Notes:
- As I've said, it's under-development, so more versions are comming soon.
